# Worklog

Active repo-level status for `tokenledger-wt`.

## Current State

- Structural modularization is complete. The original monolithic `src/main.rs` was split into domain modules with a thin entrypoint and shared `lib.rs`.
- The compile-blocker narrative in the older closeout docs is stale. The latest refactor summary records the import/export cleanup as complete.
- Current validated quality state from the active summary set is:
  - `cargo test`: 64 passing tests
  - `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`: clean
  - `cache.rs::maybe_write_unpriced_outputs` is no longer a stub

## Completed

- Split the original `main.rs` into `cli`, `models`, `analytics`, `pricing`, `bench`, `ingest`, `orchestrate`, and `utils`.
- Added `src/lib.rs` and reduced `src/main.rs` to a thin dispatch layer.
- Preserved behavior through the modularization pass and restored compile/test health after the initial import-resolution breakage.
- Kept the dated worklog entries under `docs/worklog/` as implementation history instead of active status.

## Open Concerns

- `utils.rs` and `ingest.rs` remain large even after the refactor. Future work should continue the decomposition rather than treat the current split as final.
- The docs tree still contains duplicated and fragmented material under `docs/fragemented/`. That content should remain archival until a dedicated docs cleanup pass merges or archives it cleanly.

## Next Actions

- Continue the second-stage module split for oversized source files, starting with shared utility and ingestion paths.
- Keep the canonical repo status here in `docs/WORKLOG.md` and treat root summary files as historical evidence unless they introduce newer validation data.
- Preserve the dated entries in `docs/worklog/INDEX.md` as the chronology of the modularization wave.
